            <p>Description: For the freedom project, our class worked all year to learn how to code before we could begin the project. We learned HTML first and then we learned CSS. We learned different types of code to make websites look nice, it was a lot of work. It was honestly stressful sometimes but I’m finished and learned new skills. This portfolio contains my final website and blog entries. <br><br>
Project: My project was about Blacksmiths and all they do for us. I chose blacksmithing because I think it's cool. They make a lot of cool things for us like in medieval times they made swords, shields, armor and more.<br> <br>
Challenges: My first challenge was figuring out what I wanted to do my project on. It was hard to choose because there are so many different options, I didn’t know what to pick. Mr. Mueller came by and helped me pick one and I chose Blacksmiths. Learning to code was really hard because there is a lot that goes into coding. Basically, it's in everything we use like computers, mice, tables and phones especially. We carry phones everyday, we use them to talk to each other and daily tasks like using GPS or checking email. Trying to make text show up on the screen properly was a challenge for me. There were different HTML tags I had to use and they wouldn’t always work properly with each other. I had to learn to make the tags work properly by putting them in a different order in the code. This fixed the issue and the text was finally working!<br><br>
Takeaway: My takeaway was learning how to do research for coding. I learned that if I didn’t know something about a piece of code, I would search it up and see what kind of problems I might have so I could fix the issue. My website kept having a 404 error when I tried to open the link. I had to test the placement of slashes in the text. I made a copy and moved it and then it worked. Testing is important because it helps you find certain issues in the code you are working on. Making sure slashes are in the right place is important because it can really mess up your code and make things not work properly.
